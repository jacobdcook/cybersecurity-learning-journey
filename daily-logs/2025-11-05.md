# Progress Update - Late October to Early November 2025

## Getting Back on Track

After taking some time off from formal Security+ lab work, I've been working on various projects and career development activities. While I've been busy with other work, I've now completed my first lab section in 2 months - Section 11: Zero-day Vulnerabilities and Malware Analysis.

## Recent Activities

### Other Work (Late September - October)
- Continued career development and skill building across multiple areas
- Worked on various personal projects and technical challenges
- Focused on other learning and professional development areas
- Maintained engagement with cybersecurity concepts through reading and research
- Explored additional security tools and methodologies

### Lab Work Resumed - Section 11: Zero-day Vulnerabilities and Malware Analysis

Completed comprehensive lab covering videos 40-43:

- **Video 40: Zero-day Vulnerabilities** - Researched patch status and vulnerability tracking
- **Video 41: An Overview of Malware** - System baseline analysis and malware overview
- **Video 42: Viruses and Worms** - Detection and analysis techniques
- **Video 43: Spyware and Bloatware** - Registry analysis and system monitoring

### Lab Activities Completed

1. **Zero-day Vulnerability Research** - Checked Windows 10 Pro 2009 patch status (KB5063709 dated 8/16/2025)
2. **System Baseline Analysis** - Documented system configuration and baseline
3. **Virus and Worm Detection** - Analyzed system for virus and worm indicators
4. **Spyware and Bloatware Detection** - Registry analysis and system monitoring
5. **Registry Analysis** - Examined registry for suspicious entries
6. **Network Traffic Analysis** - Monitored network connections
7. **Malware Detection and Antivirus Status** - Verified Windows Defender status and detection capabilities

### Technical Details

- **System:** Windows 10 Pro 2009
- **Patch:** KB5063709 (8/16/2025)
- **File Hash:** SHA256 85EAD5F332D5C6F3680C8EED64BBC515935699E11FEC9642FD3DF9BA77772A23
- **Screenshots:** 7 screenshots documented and organized

## Progress Update

- **Section 11:** Complete with all screenshots and documentation (First lab section completed in 2 months)
- **Video Progress:** Videos 40-43 completed
- **Lab Status:** Section 11 fully documented in lab repository
- **Total Labs:** 11 sections completed (counting Section 11)
- **Next Up:** Section 12

## Technical Changes

- Fixed slow systeminfo command → switched to Get-ComputerInfo
- Updated Windows Defender cmdlets → used Get-Service and Get-CimInstance
- Organized all 7 screenshots with proper naming convention
- Updated lab repository with complete Section 11 documentation

## Key Insights

- Zero-day vulnerabilities require constant monitoring and patch management
- Malware analysis requires systematic approach: baseline → detection → analysis
- Registry analysis is crucial for spyware and bloatware detection
- Windows Defender provides good baseline protection but requires proper configuration
- Hands-on labs are essential for understanding malware behavior

## Goals Moving Forward

- **This Month:** Continue with lab work and maintain consistency
- **Focus:** Complete Section 12 and advance through remaining Security+ content
- **Long-term:** Complete Security+ certification and advance career

## Notes

- This marks my return to hands-on lab work after 2 months
- Section 11 is the newest lab work completed since September
- All changes committed and pushed to lab repository: https://github.com/jacobdcook/security-plus-labs
- Ready to continue with Section 12 and get back into regular lab work
